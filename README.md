# My Github account would show my progress and work through repositories. 
# I created a repository on my github account to showcase my README file.
# I downloaded github desktop and logged in. I clicked on File and chose "Clone repository". A window with a list of repositories will open. I chose which repository I would like to clone then chose where to save the file.
